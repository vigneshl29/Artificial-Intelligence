I used Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression of degree 2 & 3, Decision Tree and Random Forest to solve this problem. 

Using Linear Regression, model got score of around 45%.

Since this is facing higher bias, i tried using polynomial features.

And upon increasing model complexity, Random Forest gives score of around 98% for training data and 91% for test data.

Still we can fine tune the model hyperparemeters to reduce variance.

Since this model is facing high variance, we can reduce the features, and also we can increase regularization.
