Assessing the value of energy efficiency improvements can be challenging as there's no way to truly know how much energy a building would have used without the improvements. The best we can do is to build counterfactual models. Once a building is overhauled the new (lower) energy consumption is compared against modeled values for the original building to calculate the savings from the retrofit. More accurate models could support better market incentives and enable lower cost financing.

This competition challenges you to build these counterfactual models across four energy types based on historic usage rates and observed weather. The dataset includes three years of hourly meter readings from over one thousand buildings at several different sites around the world.

Files

train.csv
building_id - Foreign key for the building metadata.
meter - The meter id code. Read as {0: electricity, 1: chilledwater, 2: steam, 3: hotwater}. Not every building has all meter types.
timestamp - When the measurement was taken
meter_reading - The target variable. Energy consumption in kWh (or equivalent). Note that this is real data with measurement error, which we expect will impose a baseline level of modeling error. UPDATE: as discussed here, the site 0 electric meter readings are in kBTU.


building_meta.csv
site_id - Foreign key for the weather files.
building_id - Foreign key for training.csv
primary_use - Indicator of the primary category of activities for the building based on EnergyStar property type definitions
square_feet - Gross floor area of the building
year_built - Year building was opened
floor_count - Number of floors of the building


weather_[train/test].csv
Weather data from a meteorological station as close as possible to the site.
site_id
air_temperature - Degrees Celsius
cloud_coverage - Portion of the sky covered in clouds, in oktas
dew_temperature - Degrees Celsius
precip_depth_1_hr - Millimeters
sea_level_pressure - Millibar/hectopascals
wind_direction - Compass direction (0-360)
wind_speed - Meters per second


test.csv
The submission files use row numbers for ID codes in order to save space on the file uploads. test.csv has no feature data; it exists so you can get your predictions into the correct order.
row_id - Row id for your submission file
building_id - Building id code
meter - The meter id code
timestamp - Timestamps for the test data period
